title: Troubleshooting

In case you're experiencing problems with using ParaViewWeb, here is a list of solutions to some frequently encountered issues. If this page doesn't help you solve your problem, try doing a search on [GitHub](https://github.com/kitware/paraviewweb/issues) or our [Mailing list](http://www.paraview.org/mailman/listinfo/paraview).

## Can't find application

ParaViewWeb is not an application in itself, but a library or framework.
If you were expecting an application out of ParaViewWeb you were probably looking for either [Visualizer](https://github.com/kitware/visualizer), [LightViz](https://github.com/kitware/light-viz) or [ArticViewer](https://github.com/kitware/arctic-viewer).
